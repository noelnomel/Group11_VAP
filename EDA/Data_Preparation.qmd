# 1 Overview

This page will explain in detail how we extract the data from the [Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS)](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/) website and how we clean the data for our subsequent analysis.

# 2 Data Extraction

On the [MSS Historical Daily Records](#0) page, we are able to select the weather station, month and year to display. After that, we can click on the CSV option to download the data.

For this project, we will analyse the historical temperature and rainfall data collected by MSS based on the 18 weather stations (Table 1).

The selected stations with complete datasets from 1980 onwards provide a long-term perspective on climate trends, which is crucial for accurate modelling and prediction. Automated instruments from 2009 enhance data reliability and allow continuous monitoring without manual intervention gaps.

As there are 42 years of monthly data to download for each station, my team has written a Robotic Process Automation script using UiPath software to download all the necessary data. In total, we have 5,552 CSV files downloaded.

# 3 Data Preparation

## 3.1 Installing R packages

The code below uses `p_load()` of the Pacman package to check if all the required packages are installed on the laptop. If they are, then they will be launched into the R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(readr, tidyverse, forecast, janitor, fs, visdat)
```

## 3.2 Importing data

Let's read all the 5,547 CSV files downloaded for the 18 weather stations that have records from the year 1980 onwards.

-   [`dir_ls()`](https://fs.r-lib.org/reference/dir_ls.html) function from the **fs** package in R to list *filenames* in our directory where we have saved the monthly historical records.

-   [`map_df()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/purrr/versions/0.2.5/topics/map) function from the **purrr** package is used to iterate over each file in the directory.

-   `locale` argument in `read_csv()` is to specify the encoding as [Latin-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1), as some of the headers contain special characters, like the degree symbol (°). The Latin-1 encoding ensures R can read and process such special characters.

-   [`col_types`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/cols.html) argument imports all columns as character data type.

-   [`clean_names()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/janitor/versions/1.2.0/topics/clean_names) of the **janitor** package converts into snake case and transliterates special characters such as the degree symbol (°) to ASCII.

```{r}
#| eval: False
filenames <- fs::dir_ls("data/raw_data/") 

# Read all files and clean the column names
data <- filenames %>%
    map_df(~ read_csv(.x, 
                      locale = locale(encoding = "latin1"),
                      col_types = cols(.default = "character")
                      ) %>% 
             janitor::clean_names()
    ) 

glimpse(data)
```

::: callout-note
All the 18 weather stations have a total of 168,836 records.

The data shows that there are two sets of variables for mean, maximum, and minimum temperature records:

-   mean_temperature_c, maximum_temperature_c, and minimum_temperature_c

-   mean_temperature_a_c, maximum_temperature_a_c, and minimum_temperature_a_c

Some year's data are in the first set of variables and others are in the second set of variables. This might happen during `clean_names()` where there is a minor difference in the column names from different files.
:::

It will be meaningful to also analyse weather data by region in Singapore. Hence, we also searched for each weather station's region on public websites like the HDB website and data.gov.sg. Let's import the region information now.

```{r}
#| eval: True
region <- read_csv("data/Region.csv") 
glimpse(region)
```

## 3.3 Data Wrangling

### 3.3.1 Remove extra columns

Let's use the `coalesce()` function to copy the values from the second set of temperature values to the first set and then deselect the second set of columns. We are also not focusing on the wind speed variables, hence we will deselect the 2 variables on wind speed.

```{r}
#| eval: False
data$mean_temperature_c <- coalesce(data$mean_temperature_c, 
                                    data$mean_temperature_a_c) 
data$maximum_temperature_c <- coalesce(data$maximum_temperature_c, 
                                       data$maximum_temperature_a_c)
data$minimum_temperature_c <- coalesce(data$minimum_temperature_c,     
                                       data$minimum_temperature_a_c)

data %>% 
  select(-c(mean_temperature_a_c, 
            maximum_temperature_a_c, 
            minimum_temperature_a_c, 
            mean_wind_speed_km_h, 
            max_wind_speed_km_h))

glimpse(data)
```

### 3.3.2 Remove weird characters

There are some weird characters ('\u0097') in the data frame. Let's replace them with NA.

```{r}
#| eval: False
data <- data %>% 
  mutate_all(~ ifelse(. == "\u0097", NA, .))
glimpse(data)
```

### 3.3.3 Tidy the data

Finally, let's clean up the weather data and create a column for date, change the necessary columns to numeric, and shorten the column names for simplicity.

```{r}
#| eval: False
weather <- data %>% 
  mutate(station = station,
       year = as.numeric(year),
       Date = make_date(year = year, month = month, day = 1),
       month = lubridate::month(Date, label = TRUE),         
       day = as.numeric(day),
       daily_rainfall_total_mm = as.numeric(daily_rainfall_total_mm), 
       highest_30_min_rainfall_mm = as.numeric(highest_30_min_rainfall_mm), 
       highest_60_min_rainfall_mm = as.numeric(highest_60_min_rainfall_mm),
       highest_120_min_rainfall_mm = as.numeric(highest_120_min_rainfall_mm),
       mean_temperature_c = as.numeric(mean_temperature_c), 
       maximum_temperature_c = as.numeric(maximum_temperature_c), 
       minimum_temperature_c = as.numeric(minimum_temperature_c)) %>% 
  rename(
    Station = station,
    Year = year,
    Month = month,
    Day = day,
    Rainfall = daily_rainfall_total_mm,
    Rainfall30 = highest_30_min_rainfall_mm,
    Rainfall60 = highest_60_min_rainfall_mm,
    Rainfall120 = highest_120_min_rainfall_mm,
    MeanTemperature = mean_temperature_c,
    MaxTemperature = maximum_temperature_c,
    MinTemperature = minimum_temperature_c
  ) %>% 
  subset(select = -c(mean_temperature_a_c,
                     maximum_temperature_a_c,
                     minimum_temperature_a_c, 
                     mean_wind_speed_km_h, 
                     max_wind_speed_km_h))
```

### 3.3.4 Merge datasets

Let's join the weather data with its region information using the common variable 'Station'.

```{r}
#| eval: False
weather <- merge(weather, region, by= "Station")
glimpse(weather)
```

### 3.3.5 Create subsets of data

Let's create subsets of weather data for only Temperature or Rainfall and save them as RDS files for easy loading when we are developing for the subsequent analysis.

```{r}
#| eval: True
Temp_YM <- weather %>% 
   group_by(Station, Region, Year, Month) %>% 
   reframe(Date = Date,            
           MeanTemp = round(mean(MeanTemperature, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           MaxTemp = round(max(MaxTemperature, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           MinTemp = round(min(MinTemperature, na.rm = TRUE),1) ) %>% 
   distinct() %>% 
   ungroup() %>% 
   filter(!is.na(MeanTemp))

write_rds(Temp_YM, "data/temperature.rds")

Rainfall_YM <- weather %>% 
   group_by(Station, Region, Year, Month) %>% 
   reframe(Date = Date,
           TotalRainfall = round(sum(Rainfall, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           TotalRainfall30 = round(sum(Rainfall30, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           TotalRainfall60 = round(sum(Rainfall60, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           TotalRainfall120 = round(sum(Rainfall120, na.rm = TRUE),1)) %>% 
   distinct() %>% 
   ungroup() %>% 
   filter(!is.na(TotalRainfall))

write_rds(Rainfall_YM, "data/rainfall.rds")
```

Check to ensure there is no missing data in Temp_YM and Rainfall_YM.

```{r}
#| eval: True
vis_miss(Temp_YM)
vis_miss(Rainfall_YM)
```

Finally, we create further subsets to be used in Confirmatory Data Analysis:

```{r}
temperature <- read_rds("data/temperature.rds")

Temp_Annual <- temperature %>%
  group_by(Station, Region, Year) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Mean_Temp = round(mean(MeanTemp, na.rm = TRUE),1),
            Avg_Max_Temp = round(mean(MaxTemp, na.rm = TRUE),1),
            Avg_Min_Temp = round(mean(MinTemp, na.rm = TRUE),1),
            Max_Temp = round(max(MaxTemp, na.rm = TRUE),1),
            Min_Temp = round(min(MinTemp, na.rm = TRUE),1)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(!is.na(Avg_Mean_Temp))

write_rds(Temp_Annual, "data/temp_annual.rds")

Temp_Monthly <- temperature %>%
  group_by(Station, Region, Year, Month) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Mean_Temp = round(mean(MeanTemp, na.rm = TRUE),1),
            Avg_Max_Temp = round(mean(MaxTemp, na.rm = TRUE),1),
            Avg_Min_Temp = round(mean(MinTemp, na.rm = TRUE),1),
            Max_Temp = round(max(MaxTemp, na.rm = TRUE),1),
            Min_Temp = round(min(MinTemp, na.rm = TRUE),1)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(!is.na(Avg_Mean_Temp))

write_rds(Temp_Monthly, "data/temp_monthly.rds")

rainfall <- read_rds("data/rainfall.rds")

Rainfall_Annual <- rainfall %>%
  group_by(Station, Region, Year) %>% 
   reframe(Total_Rf = round(sum(TotalRainfall, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Total_Rf_30 = round(sum(TotalRainfall30, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Total_Rf_60 = round(sum(TotalRainfall60, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Total_Rf_120 = round(sum(TotalRainfall120, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Avg_Total_Rf = round(mean(TotalRainfall, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Avg_Total_Rf30 = round(mean(TotalRainfall30, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Avg_Total_Rf60 = round(mean(TotalRainfall60, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Avg_Total_Rf120 = round(mean(TotalRainfall120, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Min_Total_Rf = round(min(TotalRainfall, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Max_Total_Rf = round(max(TotalRainfall, na.rm = TRUE),1)) %>% 
   distinct() %>% 
   ungroup() %>% 
   filter(!is.na(Total_Rf))

write_rds(Rainfall_Annual, "data/rf_annual.rds")

Rainfall_Monthly <- rainfall %>%
  group_by(Station, Region, Year, Month) %>% 
   reframe(Total_Rf = round(sum(TotalRainfall, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Total_Rf_30 = round(sum(TotalRainfall30, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Total_Rf_60 = round(sum(TotalRainfall60, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Total_Rf_120 = round(sum(TotalRainfall120, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Avg_Total_Rf = round(mean(TotalRainfall, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Avg_Total_Rf30 = round(mean(TotalRainfall30, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Avg_Total_Rf60 = round(mean(TotalRainfall60, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Avg_Total_Rf120 = round(mean(TotalRainfall120, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Min_Total_Rf = round(min(TotalRainfall, na.rm = TRUE),1),
           Max_Total_Rf = round(max(TotalRainfall, na.rm = TRUE),1)) %>% 
   distinct() %>% 
   ungroup() %>% 
   filter(!is.na(Total_Rf))

write_rds(Rainfall_Monthly, "data/rf_monthly.rds")
```
