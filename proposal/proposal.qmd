# 1. Introduction

> "Climate change is an existential threat for all of us, but especially for a small island state like Singapore. ... Singapore will do our part, together with other countries, to address climate change."

The emission of greenhouse gases, primarily from human activities, has unequivocally increased global warming; global surface temperature was 1.09째C higher in 2011 - 2020 than 1850 - 1900[^1]. Closer to home, the Meteorological Service Singapore's (MSS) Centre for Climate ResearcghSingapore (CCRS) and the UK Met Office, conducted a study to contextualise the findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report. The study found that mean temperatures rose at an average rate of 0.25째C per decade, and that daily mean temperatures are projected to increase by 1.4째C to 4.6째C[^2].

Furthermore, a warmer climate leads to the thermal expansion of the sea and the melting of glaciers and ice caps, which lead to rising sea levels, threatening our island nation[^3]. According to the study, the sea level in the Straits of Singapore rose at the rate of 1.2mm to 1.7mm per year between 1975 to 2009, and is projected to increase by about 1m by the end of the century.

As a low-lying island state, Singapore is very vulnerable to the effects of climate change[^4]. The need to act is urgent and the Singapore government expects to spend S\$100 billion or more over the next 100 years to invest in engineering solutions to protect Singapore's coastlines from rising sea levels.

# 2. Project Objectives

The motivation of the project is to explore the compelling case of the imapct of climate change on Singapore and how it threatens Singapore's existence. This is of grave concern to all Singaporeans with a stake in the country. The main objectives of the project can be broken down into the following areas:

1.  Create clear and easy-to-understand visualisations of past trends to increase the public's awareness,

2.  Model and predict future trends to assist the government's efforts using historical data, and

3.  Drive the need for lifestyle changes to slow down the impact of climate change.

To achieve the objectives of the project, an online application will be developed using RShiny to provide an interactive platform for members of the public to gain clear insights on Singapore's weather trends. Furthermore, the app will allow users to model outcomes of possible futures using interactive parameters.

# 3. Data

The dataset used in this study is prepared and maintained by the Meterological Service Singapore (MSS). The MSS collects rainfall, temperature, and wind speed data from available weather stations since 1980. However, a quick scan of the [MSS Historical Daily Records site](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/) shows that not all weather stations recorded all data types from 1980. This is because manual observations were replaced with automated instruments from 2009[^5].

This means that there are some gaps in the data set:

-   37 out of the 63 weather stations only recorded rainfall data starting between 2009 and 2011.

-   41 out of the 63 weather stations does not record temperature data, even up to now.

-   Out of the 22 weather stations that record temperature data, only three stations recorded data from the 1980s (from 1982 in Changi and from 1986 in Tengah and Paya Lebar).

The gaps in the data set can be addressed by....

For the purpose of this project, we will analyse the historical temperature and rainfall data collected by MSS.

The proposed methodologies to be used in this study are elaborated in the next section.

# 4. Methodology and Analysis

## 4.1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisations

Firstly, we will create visualisations to conduct exploratory data analysis to discover trends in Singapore's historical temperature and rainfall data. Some visualisations that can be used include:

-   Time series line chart to plot changes in mean temperature across the years

-   Bar chart to plot trends in total and average rainfall by year

-   Heatmap to plot temperature and rainfall by month and year

-   Ridgeline plots to plot mean and max temperature and rainfall by region

Some interactivity can be included in the plots, such as coordinated multiple views to show temperature and rainfall data side-by-side. Animations can be used to showcase changes in temperature and rainfall over the years.

## 4.2. Predictive Model

# 5. Scope of Work

# 6. Conclusion

The aim of this project is to create an interactive platform on RShiny to visualise the past trends and to predict the future trends of Singapore's climate. This platform can be used as an educational tool to help raise awareness on the urgency of the situation and to urge individuals and organisations to make incremental lifestyle changes that contribute to the Singapore Green Plan 2030.
